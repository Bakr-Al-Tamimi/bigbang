Oh, and another bullet point for luck =E2=80=A6


  *   Web search reference   https://portal.3gpp.org/3gppreferences/SearchRef=
erences.aspx
Allows you to search for which specs have a reference (in the references clau=
se) to any spec of interest, or vice versa (which specs are referenced by a g=
iven spec).
Useful when contemplating withdrawing a spec, or not promoting it to the next=
 Release, so you can raise CRs to eliminate references which would be broken =
if the referenced spec no longer exists.

Gents (and any Ladies who might be listening in)

Some more tools you may not yet have stumbled across:


  *   3GPP TR 21.905  https://www.3gpp.org/DynaReport/21905.htm
Vocabulary (terms and abbreviations) used in 3GPP specs.
Not fully comprehensive by any means, but is intended to contain terms and ab=
breviations used in more than one spec.
  *   TEDDI   https://webapp.etsi.org/Teddi/
Terms and abbreviations used in (all) published ETSI standards including tran=
spositions of 3GPP specs.
Comprehensive (or bewildering), even when constrained to entries for 3GPP doc=
uments alone. Warning: contains entries ONLY for 3GPP specs which have been p=
ublished by ETSI =E2=80=93 so excludes 3GPP-internal TRs, and TSs not yet und=
er change control or under change control in a Release not yet stage-3 frozen.
  *   The 3GPP advanced search engine   http://isearch.3gpp.org/isysadvsearch=
.html
Capable of free-text searching any page on the 3GPP web site or any document =
on the 3GPP file server (well over a million meeting contributions and spec v=
ersions)
So comprehensive it is mind-boggling. The problem is not that you don=E2=80=
=99t get a hit when searching for something, but that, however carefully you =
refine your search criteria, you get ten thousand hits. Nevertheless, you jus=
t might get lucky.
  *   When all else fails =E2=80=A6 Google.
You will be surprised how good Google is at finding obscure terms in 3GPP spe=
cs. Or maybe you will not be surprised. I know many people start their search=
 for obscure terminology at Google, and go away perfectly satisfied.
I hope these options might add to the sum total of human happiness.

Hello Jens,

thanks for your feedback. What you propose would be a useful addition I think=
; currently it is not possible in 3GPP.guru.

  *   adding a verbose list of TR/TS that *define* a specific acronym is easi=
est to add since that information is already in. Only the client side needs a=
n additional display format.
  *   adding a verbose list of TR/TS that *mention* (use) a specific acronym =
requires a new function in the parser code too. I=E2=80=99m already adding pa=
rsing for references to other TR/TS docs; so it would be easy to add acronyms=

 large.

Dear Georg,

Thanks for the quick reply and the link.
Looks good, too and will provide a useful addition to search the bewildering =
array of 3GPP specs.

I do like the fact the results page lists the respective WG, too, AND one can=
 look up specs per WG!
That=E2=80=99s very neat.

Allow me to offer a thought.

  *   If I enter =E2=80=9CS1=E2=80=9D under =E2=80=9CSearch 3GPP Specs=E2=80=
=9D and hit the =E2=80=9CSpecs=E2=80=9D button, a long list of docs is genera=
ted.
  *   Some specs have more than one revision and all the revisions are then l=
isted under the spec, which makes that specific spec row quite deep.

If and when time is available and one is inclined to do so=E2=80=A6. =E2=98=
=BA, may I propose to limit the # of revisions listed per spec to, say, the l=
ast three available?
That would greatly enhance the readability of the page.

Thanks for sharing this tool and for the work that has gone into it.
I have bookmarked it already and will most certainly use it on a regular basi=
s from now on.

Best,

Jens

Hello Tobe, all,

It seems we all meet similar problems at one time =E2=98=BA.

I have written some simple tools which collect information from the 3GPP webs=
ite and make them in a straight-forward way searchable.

For example you can find the information 24.229 under this link: BLOCKEDwhatt=
hespec[.]net/3gpp/spec[.]php?q=3D24[.]229BLOCKED

On the top of the page you can search for Work Items (just put in a string th=
at is related to the work item within the 3GPP workplan and it shows you a li=
st of WIs which contain that string), Specs (same) and tdocs (only numbers). =
Search-strings cannot include a blank, it needs to be represented by either a=
 =E2=80=9C.=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9C.*=E2=80=9D (regular expression style).

I wrote the whole thing just for myself and have no intention to bring it to =
any type of perfection. It=E2=80=99s not very reliable I guess, but so far it=
 serves me quite ok.

Cheers,
Georg

Dear Esko,

thanks for the great 3GPP.guru tool.
Been using it nearly daily and I have mentioned it to quite a few colleagues,=
 too.

I do have a challenge, which I have not been able to solve using Guru and its=
 search functions.

Example:
I would very much like to have a list of stage 3 (or stage 1 or 2) documents,=
 which mention or reference MCData or any other acronym and have a verbose re=
sults page generated that also shows the title of each spec in that specific =
stage (here in this example: stage 3).
With verbose result I mean a result that is available when I type in =E2=80=
=9C24.229=E2=80=9D and hit enter, for example.

Such as:
:: 24.229 -> hit enter
24.229 =3D TS 24.229 V15.9.0 (2019-12); TSG CT; IP multimedia call control pr=
otocol based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Session Description Pro=
tocol (SDP); Stage 3 (Release 15)
24.229 =3D TS 24.229 V16.5.0 (2020-03); TSG CT; IP multimedia call control pr=
otocol based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Session Description Pro=
tocol (SDP); Stage 3 (Release 16)

If this is type of search / verbose results generation is already possible, I=
 would be grateful for any tips and hints you might be able to provide.

Many thanks again for the hard work and a great tool.

Please don=E2=80=99t hesitate to give me a call if you have any questions.

In my experience it can be hard to understand 3GPP related communications (in=
 emails, presentations, meetings or even textbooks...) due to the many acrony=
ms.
To help with this particular aspect I created an online tool, as a side proje=
ct, and have been using it over the past months.  It looks up acronym definit=
ions from TS/TR documents.
Feel free to try it out also: BLOCKED3gpp[.]guru/BLOCKED

Also the 3GPP website tools section has some useful links: https://www.3gpp.o=
rg/technologies/tutorials-tools (https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.c=

Hello Jens,

thanks for your feedback. What you propose would be a useful addition I think=
; currently it is not possible in 3GPP.guru.

=C2=B7         adding a verbose list of TR/TS that *define* a specific acrony=
m is easiest to add since that information is already in. Only the client sid=
e needs an additional display format.

=C2=B7         adding a verbose list of TR/TS that *mention* (use) a specific=
 acronym requires a new function in the parser code too. I=E2=80=99m already =
adding parsing for references to other TR/TS docs; so it would be easy to add=
 acronyms too! That still needs a check to see if the file sizes don=E2=80=99=
t get too large.

Dear Georg,

Thanks for the quick reply and the link.
Looks good, too and will provide a useful addition to search the bewildering =
array of 3GPP specs.

I do like the fact the results page lists the respective WG, too, AND one can=
 look up specs per WG!
That=E2=80=99s very neat.

Allow me to offer a thought.

=C2=B7         If I enter =E2=80=9CS1=E2=80=9D under =E2=80=9CSearch 3GPP Spe=
cs=E2=80=9D and hit the =E2=80=9CSpecs=E2=80=9D button, a long list of docs i=
s generated.

=C2=B7         Some specs have more than one revision and all the revisions a=
re then listed under the spec, which makes that specific spec row quite deep.

If and when time is available and one is inclined to do so=E2=80=A6. =E2=98=
=BA, may I propose to limit the # of revisions listed per spec to, say, the l=
ast three available?
That would greatly enhance the readability of the page.

Thanks for sharing this tool and for the work that has gone into it.
I have bookmarked it already and will most certainly use it on a regular basi=
s from now on.

Best,

Jens

Hello Tobe, all,

It seems we all meet similar problems at one time =E2=98=BA.

I have written some simple tools which collect information from the 3GPP webs=
ite and make them in a straight-forward way searchable.

For example you can find the information 24.229 under this link: BLOCKEDwhatt=
hespec[.]net/3gpp/spec[.]php?q=3D24[.]229BLOCKED

On the top of the page you can search for Work Items (just put in a string th=
at is related to the work item within the 3GPP workplan and it shows you a li=
st of WIs which contain that string), Specs (same) and tdocs (only numbers). =
Search-strings cannot include a blank, it needs to be represented by either a=
 =E2=80=9C.=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9C.*=E2=80=9D (regular expression style).

I wrote the whole thing just for myself and have no intention to bring it to =
any type of perfection. It=E2=80=99s not very reliable I guess, but so far it=
 serves me quite ok.

Cheers,
Georg

Dear Esko,

thanks for the great 3GPP.guru tool.
Been using it nearly daily and I have mentioned it to quite a few colleagues,=
 too.

I do have a challenge, which I have not been able to solve using Guru and its=
 search functions.

Example:
I would very much like to have a list of stage 3 (or stage 1 or 2) documents,=
 which mention or reference MCData or any other acronym and have a verbose re=
sults page generated that also shows the title of each spec in that specific =
stage (here in this example: stage 3).
With verbose result I mean a result that is available when I type in =E2=80=
=9C24.229=E2=80=9D and hit enter, for example.

Such as:
:: 24.229 -> hit enter
24.229 =3D TS 24.229 V15.9.0 (2019-12); TSG CT; IP multimedia call control pr=
otocol based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Session Description Pro=
tocol (SDP); Stage 3 (Release 15)
24.229 =3D TS 24.229 V16.5.0 (2020-03); TSG CT; IP multimedia call control pr=
otocol based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Session Description Pro=
tocol (SDP); Stage 3 (Release 16)

If this is type of search / verbose results generation is already possible, I=
 would be grateful for any tips and hints you might be able to provide.

Many thanks again for the hard work and a great tool.

Please don=E2=80=99t hesitate to give me a call if you have any questions.

Kind Regards

Dear Georg,

Thanks for the quick reply and the link.
Looks good, too and will provide a useful addition to search the bewildering =
array of 3GPP specs.

I do like the fact the results page lists the respective WG, too, AND one can=
 look up specs per WG!
That=E2=80=99s very neat.

Allow me to offer a thought.

=C2=B7         If I enter =E2=80=9CS1=E2=80=9D under =E2=80=9CSearch 3GPP Spe=
cs=E2=80=9D and hit the =E2=80=9CSpecs=E2=80=9D button, a long list of docs i=
s generated.

=C2=B7         Some specs have more than one revision and all the revisions a=
re then listed under the spec, which makes that specific spec row quite deep.

If and when time is available and one is inclined to do so=E2=80=A6. =E2=98=
=BA, may I propose to limit the # of revisions listed per spec to, say, the l=
ast three available?
That would greatly enhance the readability of the page.

Thanks for sharing this tool and for the work that has gone into it.
I have bookmarked it already and will most certainly use it on a regular basi=
s from now on.

Best,

Jens

Betreff: Re: Attn: Esko Dijk - Online tool for looking up 3GPP acronyms

Hello Tobe, all,

It seems we all meet similar problems at one time =E2=98=BA.

I have written some simple tools which collect information from the 3GPP webs=
ite and make them in a straight-forward way searchable.

For example you can find the information 24.229 under this link: BLOCKEDwhatt=
hespec[.]net/3gpp/spec[.]php?q=3D24[.]229BLOCKED

On the top of the page you can search for Work Items (just put in a string th=
at is related to the work item within the 3GPP workplan and it shows you a li=
st of WIs which contain that string), Specs (same) and tdocs (only numbers). =
Search-strings cannot include a blank, it needs to be represented by either a=
 =E2=80=9C.=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9C.*=E2=80=9D (regular expression style).

I wrote the whole thing just for myself and have no intention to bring it to =
any type of perfection. It=E2=80=99s not very reliable I guess, but so far it=
 serves me quite ok.

Cheers,
Georg

Dear Esko,

thanks for the great 3GPP.guru tool.
Been using it nearly daily and I have mentioned it to quite a few colleagues,=
 too.

I do have a challenge, which I have not been able to solve using Guru and its=
 search functions.

Example:
I would very much like to have a list of stage 3 (or stage 1 or 2) documents,=
 which mention or reference MCData or any other acronym and have a verbose re=
sults page generated that also shows the title of each spec in that specific =
stage (here in this example: stage 3).
With verbose result I mean a result that is available when I type in =E2=80=
=9C24.229=E2=80=9D and hit enter, for example.

Such as:
:: 24.229 -> hit enter
24.229 =3D TS 24.229 V15.9.0 (2019-12); TSG CT; IP multimedia call control pr=
otocol based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Session Description Pro=
tocol (SDP); Stage 3 (Release 15)
24.229 =3D TS 24.229 V16.5.0 (2020-03); TSG CT; IP multimedia call control pr=
otocol based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Session Description Pro=
tocol (SDP); Stage 3 (Release 16)

If this is type of search / verbose results generation is already possible, I=
 would be grateful for any tips and hints you might be able to provide.

Many thanks again for the hard work and a great tool.

Please don=E2=80=99t hesitate to give me a call if you have any questions.

Kind Regards
on behalf

Hello all,

In my experience it can be hard to understand 3GPP related communications (in=

ms.
To help with this particular aspect I created an online tool, as a side proje=

Feel free to try it out also: BLOCKED3gpp[.]guru/BLOCKED

Hello,

Due to the conversion of the 3GPP Plenary meetings in March to e-meetings, th=
e face-to-face mentoring meeting is cancelled. I will setup a similar meeting=
 for June plenary later on.

Thanks for your understanding.

Cheers,
Georg











Hello,

This is an early placeholder for the 3GPP Mentoring face-to-face meeting at t=
he next SA/RAN/CT plenaries on Jeju Island. There will not be a dedicated pre=
sentation, we intend to discuss
a)      further steps in mentoring
b)      open questions from new participants

Depending on the number of people and the available resources we might start =
a bit later so that everybody can grab some food first.

Location and other details will be announced during the plenary meetings.

Note that we will also have a newcomer session again (Tuesday morning 7:30), =
during which we will give the usual general information and have a short Q&A.=
 Mentors can freely choose whether to attend the newcomer session or not :).

Cheers,
Georg, Lionel & Balazs

Hi Jeff,

I think that technical questions on the content of 3GPP  specifications shoul=
d either go to the related 3GPP groups / mailing lists (SA2 in this case) or =
to the rapporteur of the related specification (see https://portal.3gpp.org/#=
55936-specifications)

Hope this helps.

Cheers,
Georg

Hi,

What is the purpose of I-UPF?
In 23.501 I can only find some text in 5.33.2.2, about redundant transmission=
. However, that does not seem to require some "UPF" functionality on the tran=
sit I-UPF node (and the N4 interface between SMF and I-UPF)? As long as the U=
PF sends two copies of traffic over two disjoint N3 tunnels shouldn't it work?

Thanks.
Jeffrey

Thanks John, Kevin, Richie,

for your feedback. It seems Dynamic Spectrum Sharing is not defined in any of=
 the 3GPP documents.
And yes the input for 3GPP.Guru is automatically extracted from the 3GPP zip =
files and it also looks for inline definitions, not only from the official Ab=
breviations section.  One of the few manual additions I dared to add is =E2=
=80=9C4G=E2=80=9D ;-)

best regards
Esko

Hello all,

In my experience it can be hard to understand 3GPP related communications (in=

ms.
To help with this particular aspect I created an online tool, as a side proje=

Feel free to try it out also: https://3gpp.guru/<https://eur01.safelinks.prot=

Dear John, Esko, all,

Interesting that none of these has Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS)...

Also John did you mean 21.905 ?

Hello all,

In my experience it can be hard to understand 3GPP related communications (in=
 emails, presentations, meetings or even textbooks...) due to the many acrony=
ms.
To help with this particular aspect I created an online tool, as a side proje=
ct, and have been using it over the past months.  It looks up acronym definit=
ions from TS/TR documents.
Feel free to try it out also: https://3gpp.guru/

Also the 3GPP website tools section has some useful links: https://www.3gpp.o=

Hello,

3GPP continuously looks for effective ways to help new delegates to overcome =
initial barriers and to answer their questions. One of the activities we agre=
ed on recently is to establish a mentoring process.

The process is not based on a 1-to-1 relation between a mentor and a mentee, =
but an open forum in which new delegates (=E2=80=9Cnewcomers=E2=80=9D) can ea=
sily approach mentors with their questions about 3GPP processes, structure an=
d work. This communication should take place during 3GPP meetings but also of=
fline. For the offline case we have created this mailing list and hope it wil=
l be used frequently.

As said before this mechanism is in its very early stage and most likely we w=
ill all learn a lot over the next months on how to best handle the related qu=
estions and discussions. I know that everybody will take an open mind and wor=
k to make the 3GPP community more accessible and welcoming =E2=80=93 thank yo=
u all in advance for that.

I copy the slide with the mentors we have so far below. Thanks to the four of=
 them =E2=80=93 they volunteered during the 3GPP SA meeting in September. Obv=
iously we look for extending the pool of mentors over the next week, especial=
ly also into the regions of RAN and CT and also get more delegates from the d=
ifferent working groups on board.

So please, don=E2=80=99t be shy. Ask questions and help us create a process t=
hat serves us all best.

Thank you all and cheers,
Georg

Hello Georg,

=20

This is a great initiative from 3GPP for both RAN and SA groups. I would like=
 to know if there is an opportunity to meet some mentors face to face in upco=
ming meetings at SITGES, Spain (on the sidelines of Plenary meetings).

=20

-best regards

Hey all, Hey Georg,

=20

Thank you so much for organizing this event for the newcomers, it was really =
helpful (and a great opportunity to know other new delegates). I'm just writi=
ng to ask about the standard of becoming a mentor, so that I can perhaps reco=
mmend some of my colleagues and ask if they would love to join this mentoring=
 program.

=20

Thanks again for your effort in organizing this training program, it really m=
eans a lot at least to some of us ;)

Hello,

=20

3GPP continuously looks for effective ways to help new delegates to overcome =
initial barriers and to answer their questions. One of the activities we agre=
ed on recently is to establish a mentoring process.

=20

The process is not based on a 1-to-1 relation between a mentor and a mentee, =
but an open forum in which new delegates (=E2=80=9Cnewcomers=E2=80=9D) can ea=
sily approach mentors with their questions about 3GPP processes, structure an=
d work. This communication should take place during 3GPP meetings but also of=
fline. For the offline case we have created this mailing list and hope it wil=
l be used frequently.

=20

As said before this mechanism is in its very early stage and most likely we w=
ill all learn a lot over the next months on how to best handle the related qu=
estions and discussions. I know that everybody will take an open mind and wor=
k to make the 3GPP community more accessible and welcoming =E2=80=93 thank yo=
u all in advance for that.
