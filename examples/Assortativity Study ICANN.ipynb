    "Everything is a network. [Assortativity](http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0205405v1.pdf) is an interesting property of networks. It is the tendency of nodes in a network to be attached to other nodes that are similar in some way. In social networks, this is sometimes called \"homophily.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "One kind of assortativity that is particularly descriptive of network topology is *degree assortativity*. This is what it sounds like: the *assortativity* (tendency of nodes to attach to other nodes that are similar) of *degree* (the number of edges a node has).\n",
    "\n",
    "A suggestive observation by [Newman (2002)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0205405v1.pdf) is that *social* networks such as academic coauthorship networks and film collaborations tend to have positive degree assortativity, while *technical* and *biological* networks tend to have negative degree assortativity. Another way of saying this is that they are *disassortatively mixed*. This has implications for the ways we model these networks forming as well as the robustness of these networks to the removal of nodes.\n",

    "One kind of network that we can extract from open source project data are networks of email replies from public mailing lists. [Mailing lists and discussion forums](http://producingoss.com/en/message-forums.html) are often the first point of contact for new community members and can be the site of non-technical social processes that are necessary for the maintenance of the community. Of all the communications media used in coordinating the cooperative work of open source development, mailing lists are the most \"social\".\n",

    "We are going to look at the mailing lists associated with a number of open source and on-line collaborative projects. We will construct for each list a network for which nodes are email senders (identified by their email address) and edges are the number of times a sender has replied directly to another participant on the list. Keep in mind that these are public discussions and that in a sense every reply is sent to everybody."
