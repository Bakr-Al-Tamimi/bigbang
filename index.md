### BigBang

BigBang is a tool for scientific analysis of Internet standards development and Internet governance communities.

With BigBang you download mailinglist and analyze them using statistical, discursive, and network analysis. 

You can use BigBang to research Internet governance communities, but it has also been used to analyze open source communities. You can even use BigBang in class or in a seminar to teach the basic of Jupyter notebooks.

We have included quite some references for potential mailinglists for you to scrape (e.g. IETF, ICANN, RIPE, W3C), and a lot of Jupyter notebooks to analyze the mailinglists.

If at any time you are having troubles using BigBang, have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/datactive/bigbang/README.md">readme file</a> or send an email to our <a href="https://lists.ghserv.net/mailman/listinfo/bigbang-user">user list</a>.
